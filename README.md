A vector geometry dungeon layout editor. Wall geometry is placable using extruded vector geometry. Room templates made of combined walls can be selected and placed. 

It has an [A*](http://arongranberg.com/astar/) path finding simulation running, the debug agent is continually tracking the pointer world location by avoiding the wall geometry.

Placed wall end points can be edit repositioned. Placing a wall endpoint at an pre existing endpoint location will connect them. Placing a wall endpoint at an existing wall edge location will also connect them.
