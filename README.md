A vector geometry dungeon layout editor. Wall geometry is placable using extruded vector geometry. Room templates made of combined walls can be selected and placed. 

It has an [A*](http://arongranberg.com/astar/) navigation simulation running, the debug agent is continually tracking the pointer world location by avoiding wall geometry.

Placed wall end point can be repositined. Placing an endpoint at an pre existing endpoint location will connect them. Placing a wall endpoint at an existing wall edge location will connect them
